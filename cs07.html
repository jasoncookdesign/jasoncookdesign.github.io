            <h2>The challenge</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> The Leading Hotels of the World (LHW) differs from your average travel site. For 90 years, LHW has catered to the tastes of discerning travelers by offering a hand-selected collection of unique properties worldwide that meet their customers' high standards. If you want to book a castle, palace, mountain hideaway, safari camp, or private island, LHW is the white-glove travel concierge of choice. </p>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> LHW tapped my team to redefine their online experience, balancing function and inspiration. I led the team that researched their customers' needs to strike that balance, designing the beautiful yet intuitive web experience that delivered the client's ultimate goalâ€”increased online conversions. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs07_01.jpg" alt="full final site" />
            <h2>What they had</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> The existing LHW.com site was ill-equipped to meet LHW's customers' expectations. It was starkly unattractive, navigationally confusing, and didn't behave well on touch-based mobile devices. The site was plagued with ambiguity in its visual hierarchy, hamstrung by an unintelligible information architecture, peppered with out-of-date technology like Java applets and Flash widgets, and largely unable to get customers through the booking funnel, the site's primary purpose. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs07_02.jpg" alt="old site" />
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> The one aspect of the existing site I sought to preserve was LHW's longstanding investment in high-quality photography and copywriting. My goal was to elevate it to the prominence it deserved while simultaneously wrapping it in a seamlessly integrated booking experience. </p>
            <h2>Improving information architecture</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> The site's first and most essential purpose is to enable customers to book travel. That's why the redesign began with redesigning the booking flow from square one. By studying the client site's metrics, I identified the critical breakdowns in their sales funnel. That intelligence informed the placement of critical gatekeeping features like registration and paywalls, highlighting higher conversion opportunities to upsell services like premium membership. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs07_03.jpg" alt="booking flow" />
            <h2>Inspiring interaction</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> The LHW site is much more than a simple booking site. The brand prides itself on the depth and quality of its curation and local knowledge. Research showed that customers were interested in inspirational content, but unable to find it on the existing site. The redesign focused on doing a better job showcasing LHW's owned media content, especially the expertly written travel guides and gorgeous photography. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs07_04.jpg" alt="wireframes" />
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> After several rounds of iteration, we had a finely tuned interaction model that invited exploration while keeping the booking engine close at hand. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs07_05.jpg" alt="calendar" />
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> Subtle interaction mechanics like an expandable map created a sense of quiet expertise to the site, echoing the brand's persona while providing the essential functionality customers need to complete the task. The functional tools are clearly within reach but out of the way until the customer is ready to use them. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs07_07.jpg" alt="expandable map" />
            <h2> A suitable style for a luxury brand </h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> With a solid set of wireframes providing the site's skeleton, the next step was developing a complementary visual aesthetic. I guided a stellar team of designers to apply a conservative, serif-centric typographic treatment and a reserved, flat color palette to the wireframes, inviting customers to immerse themselves in LHW's exemplary writing and photography until they were ready to buy. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs07_06.jpg" alt="wireframe vs. composition" />
            <h2> The result </h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> The redesigned website's focus on experiential booking forges an emotional connection between discerning travelers and their planning experience. It delivers on the ultimate goal of decreasing user drop-off and increasing conversions, driving improvements to the client's bottom line. </p>
