            <h2>The challenge</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> When Apple introduced the iPhone, Microsoft's natural user interface (NUI)
              technology was still in its early research stage. With Apple being the first to market with multi-touch
              user interfaces, all eyes were on Microsoft's response. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs06_01.jpg" alt="closeup of table edge">
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> Microsoft relied on my organization to <strong>produce libraries,
                proofs-of-concept, keynote showcases, and technical demos</strong> to fast-track their NUI story.
              Ultimately, the patterns and conventions we established and even some of the code we wrote <strong>formed
                the basis for Microsoft's Surface hardware platform today</strong>. </p>
            <h2>A device built for research</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> Five years before the tablets and laptops that carry the Surface brand we know
              today, Microsoft produced an interactive coffee to facilitate research into natural user interface
              behavior, developing gesture libraries and forming the basis for a future mass-market consumer story.
              Microsoft retired the table form factor once they released the Surface Pro in 2013, shortly after
              rebranding it "PixelSense" to disambiguate it from the consumer desktops, tablets, and laptops that would
              carry the brand name. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs06_02.jpg" alt="interacting with Surface">
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> The Surface table retailed for about $10,000, so Microsoft primarily sold the
              device to commercial customers rather than home users. Consequently, the nature of our early work in
              developing applications for Surface focused on installations in public settings like retail stores,
              restaurants and hotel lobbies.</p>
            <h2>Gridless, omnidirectional interfaces</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> The original Surface is unlike any other device we had ever designed for in
              several ways. Every other screen-based interface we're familiar with has a distinct top and bottom. In
              contrast, a coffee table is omnidirectional – usable from any side with no sense of top and bottom in the
              interface. Plus, because of the size of the display, it invited more than one person to use it at a time,
              often strangers. This created <strong>unique design challenges that lead to deeply insightful user
                research sessions</strong>. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs06_03.jpg" alt="two people using snowboard app">
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> Microsoft even used an application we designed and developed in their
              Enterprise Engagement Center, a research facility for large-scale cloud services. </p>
            <img src="assets/images/cs06_07.gif" alt="Microsoft EEC" class="margin-bottom-20">
            <h2>A screen that's looking back at you</h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> Another aspect that made Surface unique was that its touchscreen used a camera
              array rather than a capacitor — it was actually "looking" at the screen from the inside. This technology
              made for some <strong>fascinating interaction opportunities through object recognition</strong>. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs06_04.gif" alt="object recognition">
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> We designed the mechanism that blurred the distinction between the physical and
              digital realms, creating interactions that seemed like magic at the time. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs06_05.jpg" alt="MobileConnect sketches">
            <h2> Cutting edge invention </h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> In addition to the interactions, we also <strong>invented the way Surface
                connected to other devices via optical means</strong>, long before Near Field Communication (NFC) was
              mature enough to initiate a Bluetooth connection. Finally, we wrote the C# and Java libraries that powered
              these interactions. </p>
            <img class="margin-bottom-20" src="assets/images/cs06_06.gif" alt="MobileConnect in action">
            <h2> Lasting impact </h2>
            <p class="margin-bottom-20"> We consider ourselves privileged to have helped develop a technology platform
              as unique as Surface. While very few people had the opportunity to experience the original Microsoft
              Surface themselves, we find deep satisfaction in the knowledge that my research, designs, inventions, and
              libraries live on today in Microsoft's ongoing natural user interface story. </p>
